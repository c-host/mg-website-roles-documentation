# Executive Summary: Roles-Based Permissioning System Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the proposed roles-based permissioning system for our Kirby CMS-backed website, addressing potential objections and outlining key features. The system aims to enable community management of the website while reducing administrative overhead.

## User Roles and Approval Process

The system implements four distinct user roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

1. Community Member: Can view and edit their own profile.
2. Research Contributor: Can edit project pages they are listed as contributers to and submit changes for review.
3. Organization Team: Can review and approve submitted changes, manage user roles, and have full content editing access.
4. Administrator: Has all permissions, including system configuration and database management.

The approval process ensures content quality:
1. Contributors submit changes
2. Staff review submissions in the approval queue
3. Staff can approve, request revisions, or reject changes
4. Automated notifications keep all parties informed

This structure balances community participation with quality control, addressing concerns about content integrity while fostering engagement.

## Key Objections and Responses

1. System Complexity
   - Objection: The system seems complex for a small organization.
   - Response: While initially complex, the system is scalable and will reduce long-term administrative overhead, streamlining processes as the organization grows.

2. Content Quality Concerns
   - Objection: Allowing community edits may compromise content quality.
   - Response: The approval workflow ensures all changes are reviewed by staff before publication, maintaining quality control while enabling broader participation.

3. Technical Implementation Challenges
   - Objection: The implementation may be too complicated for our current team.
   - Response: The system is built on the familiar Kirby CMS. We can provide additional training and support during implementation, with long-term benefits outweighing the initial learning curve.

4. Security Risks
   - Objection: More people editing the site could increase security risks.
   - Response: The roles-based system actually enhances security by providing granular control over user permissions. All actions are logged, and the approval process adds an extra layer of security.

5. Increased Staff Workload
   - Objection: Reviewing all changes might create more work for staff.
   - Response: While there will be some review work, the system streamlines this process. Overall, it should decrease staff workload by distributing content creation and updates to community members and reducing day-to-day administrative tasks.

6. Implementation Costs
   - Objection: The cost of implementing this system might be too high.
   - Response: While there are upfront costs, this is an investment that will yield returns through increased efficiency and community engagement, potentially reducing operational costs in the long run.

## Key Benefits

1. Scalability: The system can grow with the organization without significant restructuring.
2. Community Engagement: Enables broader participation in content creation and management.
3. Efficiency: Reduces administrative overhead by distributing content management tasks.
4. Quality Control: Maintains high content standards through the approval process.
5. Security: Provides granular control over user permissions and actions.

## Implementation Considerations

- Phased rollout to test and refine the system
- Staff training on the approval process and new workflows
- Regular review and updates to content guidelines
- Ongoing monitoring of system performance and user feedback

## Conclusion
The proposed roles-based permissioning system addresses key organizational needs for scalability, community engagement, and efficient content management. While there are valid concerns, the designed features and long-term benefits outweigh the initial challenges. The system offers a robust solution for growing organizations dealing with diverse content and multiple stakeholders.
