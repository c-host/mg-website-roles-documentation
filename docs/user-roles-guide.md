## Multiple Roles

Users can be assigned multiple roles to combine permissions and responsibilities. For example:

- A user can be both a Community Member and a Research Contributor, allowing them to edit their profile and contribute to specific research projects.
- Staff members might also be Research Contributors for certain projects.

When a user has multiple roles, they gain the combined permissions of all their roles. The system will always apply the most permissive role when determining access rights.

## Additional Notes
- The system must enforce that Research Contributors can only edit pages for projects where they are explicitly listed as contributors.
- Organization Staff are responsible for managing the list of contributors for each project.
- The content approval process applies to all changes made by Research Contributors, regardless of which project they're editing.
